# Why this project

This is a transition project. I was working for internationnal supply chain as project manager before to turn web developer. I was wondering how can I build a tool that I would love have ? 
This project was presented to validate (and it did) my first [certification (in FR)](https://www.francecompetences.fr/recherche/rncp/31114/)

I lear to work in project mode, build it step by step and got 1 month to build it. PHP was the backend language to support backend, frontend is made with HTML and Bootstrap for CSS. 


# How to use 

- download the package and setup a L/W/MAMP environement.
- run the project according to your configuration.

The project first involves creating an account and then you are guided through the three key steps to create the request.

There is a possibility to update your password with fake email sending containing a link (available 30min).

From the dashboard, it is possible to 
- consult the history and the status 
- modify a request

And that's it, your dashboard allow you to consult, update, create and delete a request.


# Finally

My first step in web development. A great experience to conclude a 6 months transition from project manager to junior web developer. I learnt a lot of thechnologies, process and it's a step on infinite climb of developer ;-)
