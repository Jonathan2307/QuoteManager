QuoteManager is an 'out of gauge' transport quotation management tool.

The goal is to be able to:
   - prepare requests,
   - download them in email format,
   - send them later from his local mail client
   - keep a history of requests processed.
  
The project first involves creating an account and then we are guided through the three key steps to create the demand.
From the dashboard, it is possible to consult the history, the status and to modify a request in the event of progress of the project in its realization.
