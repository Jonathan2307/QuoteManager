QuoteManager is an 'out of gauge' transport quotation management tool.

The point is to :
   - prepare requests according to pattern,
   - store projects in database,
   - get a clear view of all latest projects 
   - keep a history of requests processed.
  
The project first involves creating an account and then we are guided through the three key steps to create the request.
From the dashboard, it is possible to consult the history, the status and to modify a request in the event of progress of the project in its realization.
